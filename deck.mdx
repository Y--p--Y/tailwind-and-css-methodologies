# Tailwind & CSS methodologies

---

## 💅 State of CSS in 2019

https://2019.stateofcss.com/technologies/methodologies/

https://2019.stateofcss.com/technologies/css-frameworks/

---

# CSS methodologies

* Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)
* Block Element Modifier (BEM)
* Atomic/Functional CSS (ITCSS)
* Utility-first CSS

---

# OOCSS

https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki

* Separate structure and skin

---

# BEM

---

# Atomic

* use of single-purpose and ‘pure’ classes that consistently behave the same regardless of context 

---

> There’s no pretending that .stacked-form is any more ‘semantic’ than .align-right; they’re both named after how they affect the presentation of the markup, and we are using those classes in our markup to achieve a specific presentational result.

# Utility First

component + functional approach

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first

* pseudo-elements

---

# Tailwind

---

Take a 👀 at all the utilities...

* color: text, background, border
* padding, margin
* width, height

---

## Responsive

breakpoints:

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design/

---

## Extracting Components

✅ small components

❌ rely on CSS classes to extract complex components

---

```
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
```

---

## Customization

* extend tailwind theme
* write a plugin https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins/#adding-utilities

---

## Pros 😄

* Small css
* More cache-friendly stylesheet
* Productivity 🙅 How to name this class?

---

## Cons 🤷

* Contextually aware rules. e.g. display-mode toggle
* Theming
* Responsive design: ❌ fixed breakpoints, ✅ component-specific breakpoints
* CSS-grid
